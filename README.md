# Stroopy 

A mobile game that combats stroop effect! 

The [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) is a phenomenon that occurs when you must say the color of a word but not the name of the word. For example, blue might be printed in red and you must say the color rather than the word.

### Goal of the Game 
When you're ready to play, hit START. Follow the directions on the screen and press one of two buttons to determine if the color text matches the color meaning. Play daily and watch your high score improve! This means your mind is conditioning itself to better combat the Stroop effect.
